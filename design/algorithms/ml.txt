1.	Load and Preprocess the Data
1.1.	Read the dataset from synthetic_health_data.csv
1.2.	Separate features (X: health metrics) and target variable (y: health issue)
1.3.	Split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80:20 ratio
2.	Train the machine learning model
2.1.	Initialize the random forest classifier with the following parameters:
2.1.1.	 n_estimators: 100 (number of decision trees)
2.1.2.	 random_state: 42 (for reproducibility)
2.2.	Train the model using the training data (X_train and y_train)
2.3.	Evaluate the model by making predictions on the test set (X_test) and calculate the accuracy
2.4.	Save the trained model as health_model.pkl using joblib.
3.	Build a prediction function (API integration)
3.1.	Load the trained model (health_model.pkl) in the predict.py file
3.2.	Define a function predict_health_condition(metrics) to:
3.2.1.	 Accept a dictionary of input health metrics
3.2.2.	Convert the input data to a DataFrame format to match the model's expected input
3.2.3.	 Use the model.predict() function to generate the health issue prediction
4.	Expose the Prediction Function through a Flask API
4.1.	Create a Flask app in app.py to handle HTTP POST requests at the /predict endpoint
4.2.	Receive input data (in JSON format) from the client
4.3.	Extract the input features from the JSON request and call the predict_health_condition() function
4.4.	Return the predicted health issue as a JSON response
