1.	Update UI Based on Login Status:
•	Use updateUI() to adjust visibility for UI elements (login, register, profile, admin options) based on login status and user role stored in localStorage.
2.	Set Up Event Listeners:
•	On DOMContentLoaded, check login status, call updateUI(), and set up click events for login, logout, and profile buttons.
3.	Handle Login:
•	loginUser() sends credentials to the backend, stores user info in localStorage if successful, updates UI, and navigates to the home page.
4.	Handle Logout:
•	logout() sends a logout request, clears user info from localStorage, updates UI, and redirects to the home page.
5.	Load User Profile Data:
•	loadUserProfile() fetches and displays the user’s health history from the backend
6.	Handle Health Metrics Submission:
•	setupHealthFormListener() listens for form submission, retrieves metrics, sends data to the backend, and displays predictions and tips in the UI
7.	Navigate to Pages:
•	navigateTo() redirects to specified pages (e.g., home after login)
8.	Initialize Health Form Listener:
•	Set up health form listener on DOMContentLoaded
